# modbot
My first ever discord bot which i made using the discord.py api while learning python. It's called modbot which i use on discord servers to manage the chats and also 
added some cool features to it such as spotify playing through username, quoter from my favorite tv show, as well as an 8ball game and a movie recommender which I am working on.
